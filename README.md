# Gou(合) 

## Overview

Gou（[合](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%90%88_%28%E5%A4%A9%E6%96%87%29)) is a clone of P2P anonymous BBS shinGETsu saku in golang.

The word "Gou(合)" means [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_aspect) in Japanese, when an aspect is an angle the planets make to each other in the horoscope.

Yeah, the sun and moon are in conjunction during the new moon(新月, 朔）.
